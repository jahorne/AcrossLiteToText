# Crossword: Across Lite .puz to text file converter

This .Net Core console application converts one or more Across Lite .puz files into their text file equivalents. As of version 2.0, XML files which contain more information are also generated. [See the wiki](https://github.com/jahorne/AcrossLiteToText/wiki "See the wiki") for more info.

Compile it to run on Windows, Macs, or Unix computers.

You can edit this project here on the web, or with [Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), or using your favorite editor. I recommend the free version of Visual Studio. (Add the GitHub extension!)

The code here includes a streamlined version of core functionality from [XWord Info](https://www.xwordinfo.com "XWord Info"). Now that you can parse Across Lite files, you have a great head start if you want to research crossword data, create your own solving app, *or even build your own XWord Info competitor!*

[Read the wiki](https://github.com/jahorne/AcrossLiteToText/wiki "Read the wiki"), or contact me via the email link on the [XWord Info](https://www.xwordinfo.com "XWord Info") home page.

More XWord Info core functionality will be moved to Open Source over time.
